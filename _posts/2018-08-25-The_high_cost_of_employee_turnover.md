It has never been easier for employees to find new jobs. The internet has revolutionised the way we search for jobs, and it is easier for recruiters to communicate with future employees anywhere in the world. 

When this occurs, the replacement cost can be high and include both direct and indirect cost of replacement. The below chart highlights the lag in the time it takes to benefit from a new hire over time.

**Some roles may take two years to reach full productivity** 

As organisations being to look towards automation, the skills required for the workforce are becoming more specialised and in demand. Depending on the complexity of the role, it may take two years for the employee to reach 100% productivity vs. three months for transactional roles. 

**Voluntary turnover is costing many organisations millions of dollars**

Above the surface, some of these costs will be apparent and include direct costs such as recruitment, agency, training. 

Costs that are not talked about much include lost productivity, influence and connections as parts of these may need to reach a certain level of mastery for the employee to be fully productive. 

**Understand drivers to improve business outcomes.**

A reduction of 1% to attrition may appear low but could represent great value to the organisation, i.e. Depending on the size of the organisation, say 2500 and the annual benefit could be $2.8m. 

This is money that could be spent on other initiatives such as improving bottom line performance or other business outcomes and building intelligence to understand workforce challenges before they happen.. 

**Recommendations to improve could include;**

* First understand the cost impact by running the numbers over a 12 month period and segmenting time to productivity into 3-4 complexity groups.
* Calculating attrition rates by BU and role to understand what can be controlled.
* Completing more in-depth analysis of the survey, pay, mobility, leadership and work-life variables and intervening on high-risk employees or improving the overall employee experience
