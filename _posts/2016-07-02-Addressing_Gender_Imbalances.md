More employers are addressing gender imbalance and pay gaps, with steady improvements seen in the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/employment-and-growth/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth" target="_blank">recent</a> Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) data. 

* While we have seen these improvements, there are still some gaps.
* Men earn $26k a year more than women.
* Appointments of women to manager roles 43%.
* No increase in women on company boards, currently at 25%.

**It could add $12 trillion globally by 2025** 

Gender equality is an important issue with incredible focus from many organisations. First, it makes commercial sense, if gender equality is attained, it could add $12 trillion globally by 2025, according to a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/employment-and-growth/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth" target="_blank">2016 McKinsey Global Institute report</a>. 

Secondly, people practices are becoming more transparent and increasingly crucial for employer brand to shareholders, current and future employees as they look towards other value that the organisation creates.

**So why are few organisations reporting critical initiatives to the board?** 

The low results outlined in WGEA could be attributed to a few things such as the difficulty in tracking and managing data, data integrity issues or expertise to extract and prepare the data. 

When you have the data, finding the right insights can be tricky as you often need to find, deeper supporting information and have plans ready to address the problem with a certain level of confidence. 

Here are some recommendations to improve reporting and action.

* Gender equality is more than equal pay. The average salary cut by high-level groupings could be guiding you in the wrong direction or selling your story short. Ensuring balance across critical groups like role, industry, management level, business unit, skill level could highlight what is working well and what is not, allowing you to quickly intervene and drive improvement.

* Establish targets at the top levels of the organisation. Conduct analysis of what might be realistic at a business unit level and our role and try to push for stretch targets. When setting goals, complete review of new hires, internal movements and exits in the past 12 months with the future projected business change to give you the best chance of hitting the right outcome.

* Try to keep the definition as simple as possible. Organisations have got into hot water over changing definitions, having multiple definitions for the same metric or find it challenging to create action or drive strategy due to the resources required for report administration.

* People are naturally prone to stereotyping. Try to challenge a leadership hiring decision with supporting data. This could include modelling promotion decisions historically across key variables like demographics, mobility and leadership. Variability could indicate bias, compare this bias to other business units to challenge assumptions.

* WGEA identified a gap in leadership participation rates. A simple exercise would be to analyse parental leave return rates, i.e. what is the percentage of women who returned to the organisation after parental leave, split by business unit and role. If the rates are low, then this could be a perfect initiative to improve general mobility and leadership expertise at potentially a lower cost than it would take to hire someone externally.
