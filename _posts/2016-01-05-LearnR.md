Test your R skills with a nice interactive game called ‘Hack the Proton’. This was a recent feature on <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">R Bloggers</a>. I have provided workings to each step, work through each and try to review key concepts if unfamiliar.

First step - <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">Install R</a>. R is a free open source data science tool that is basically excel on steroids. If you complete monthly reporting each week and you spend hours on data cleaning and preparation, R can automate this for you. If you would like to understand the relationship between employee turnover to key manager behaviour, you can build statistical models in R as well! 

To make R a little easier to use, I recommend also installing <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">R Studio</a>. This is a great IDE that has many user friendly features such as variable display, integrated scripts and plotting.

Now let's test your R skills and hopefully learn a few new ones.

### Hack the proton

First install the package 'proton'. I have also used the sqldf and plyr library to complete the challenges. To install a package you can use the install.packages("packagename") command.

{% highlight ruby %}
library(sqldf)
library(plyr)
library(proton)
{% endhighlight %}

#### Output

{% highlight ruby %}
##  _____ _          _____         _              _____
## |_   _| |_ ___   |  _  |___ ___| |_ ___ ___   |   __|___ _____ ___
##   | | |   | -_|  |   __|  _| . |  _| . |   |  |  |  | .'|     | -_|
##   |_| |_|_|___|  |__|  |_| |___|_| |___|_|_|  |_____|__,|_|_|_|___|
## 
## Your goal is to find Slawomir Pietraszko's credentials for the Proton server.
## This is the only way for Bit to find the secret plans of Pietraszko's laboratory. 
## 
## Enter the `proton()` command in order to start the adventure.
## 
## Remember that at any time you may add `hint=TRUE` argument to the executed command in order to get additional suggestions.
{% endhighlight %}

To start the challenge, enter this command.

{% highlight ruby %}
proton()
{% endhighlight %}

#### Output

{% highlight ruby %}
## Pietraszko uses a password which is very difficult to guess.
## At first, try to hack an account of a person which is not as cautious as Pietraszko.
## 
## But who is the weakest point? Initial investigation suggests that John Insecure doesn't care about security and has an account on the Proton server. He may use a password which is easy to crack.
## Let's attack his account first!
## 
## Problem 1: Find the login of John Insecure.
## 
## Bit has scrapped 'employees' data (names and logins) from the www web page of Technical University of Warsaw. The data is in the data.frame `employees`. 
## Now, your task is to find John Insecure's login.
## When you finally find out what John's login is, use `proton(action = "login", login="XYZ")` command, where XYZ is Insecure's login.
{% endhighlight %}

### Warning - Spoilers below.....

### Challenge 1. Find John Insecure login

We know from the above that there is a table called employees. Let's view this quickly to understand the key variables to the dataset.

{% highlight ruby %}
employees <- employees
head(employees)
{% endhighlight %}

#### Output

{% highlight ruby %}
##     name  surname       login
## 1  Jorge  Patrick   j.patrick
## 2 Gerald     Long gerald.long
## 3 Javier  Mendoza   j.mendoza
## 4    Roy Johnston        rjoh
## 5  Annie    Keith annie.keith
## 6   Nora   Castro        ncas
{% endhighlight %}

Let's try searching for John in the database. Here I have used SQL to complete the search.

{% highlight ruby %}
sqldf('select login from employees where name like "%John%" and surname like "%Ins%"')
{% endhighlight %}

#### Output

{% highlight ruby %}
##     login
## 1 johnins
{% endhighlight %}

Nice, we now know the login, let's enter this in.

{% highlight ruby %}
proton(action="login", login="johnins")
{% endhighlight %}

#### Output

{% highlight ruby %}
## Congratulations! You have found out what John Insecure's login is!
## It is highly likely that he uses some typical password.
## Bit downloaded from the Internet a database with 1000 most commonly used passwords.
## You can find this database in the `top1000passwords` vector.
## 
## Problem 2: Find John Insecure's password.
## 
## Use `proton(action = "login", login="XYZ", password="ABC")` command in order to log into the Proton server with the given credentials.
## If the password is correct, you will get the following message:
## `Success! User is logged in!`.
## Otherwise you will get:
## `Password or login is incorrect!`.
{% endhighlight %}

### Challenge 2. Find Johns Password

Again, let's explore the key variables of this dataframe.

{% highlight ruby %}
head(top1000passwords)
{% endhighlight %}

#### Output

{% highlight ruby %}
## [1] "123456"    "password"  "12345678"  "qwerty"    "123456789" "12345"
{% endhighlight %}

loop through and try every typical password and add an if block to find out the password

{% highlight ruby %}
for (i in top1000passwords){
  x <- proton(action = "login", login="johnins", password=i)
  if(length(grep(pattern = "Success", x = x)) == 1){
    print(i)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Output

{% highlight ruby %}
## Well done! This is the right password!
## Bit used John Insecures account in order to log into the Proton server.
## It turns out that John has access to server logs.
## Now, Bit wants to check from which workstation Pietraszko is frequently logging into the Proton server. Bit hopes that there will be some useful data.  
## 
## Logs are in the `logs` dataset. 
## Consecutive columns contain information such as: who, when and from which computer logged into Proton.
## 
## Problem 3: Check from which server Pietraszko logs into the Proton server most often.
## 
## Use `proton(action = "server", host="XYZ")` command in order to learn more  about what can be found on the XYZ server.
## The biggest chance to find something interesting is to find a server from which Pietraszko logs in the most often.
## 
## [1] "q1w2e3r4t5"
{% endhighlight %}

### Challenge 3. Find Server

{% highlight ruby %}
head(logs)
{% endhighlight %}

#### Output

{% highlight ruby %}
##              login           host                data
## 1        r.spencer 193.0.96.13.15 2014-09-01 11:01:12
## 2     isaac.arnold  193.0.96.13.9 2014-09-01 11:01:51
## 3 warren.dickerson  194.29.178.32 2014-09-01 11:08:08
## 4          c.lopez   194.29.178.4 2014-09-01 11:09:02
## 5        l.russell 194.29.178.162 2014-09-01 11:22:22
## 6          t.silva 194.29.178.102 2014-09-01 11:25:40
{% endhighlight %}

SQL script to search the login of 'Piet' in the employees table.

{% highlight ruby %}
sqldf('select * from employees where surname = "Pietraszko"')
{% endhighlight %}

#### Output

{% highlight ruby %}
##       name    surname login
## 1 Slawomir Pietraszko  slap
{% endhighlight %}

Knowing his username, let's search for the right log!

{% highlight ruby %}
head(sqldf('select * from logs where login = "slap"'))
{% endhighlight %}

#### Output

{% highlight ruby %}
##   login           host                data
## 1  slap  194.29.178.16 2014-09-02 04:32:48
## 2  slap  194.29.178.16 2014-09-03 17:10:41
## 3  slap 194.29.178.108 2014-09-05 00:52:26
## 4  slap 194.29.178.108 2014-09-05 13:22:20
## 5  slap 194.29.178.108 2014-09-06 15:35:41
## 6  slap  194.29.178.16 2014-09-06 19:33:06
{% endhighlight %}

Great, we are almost there, what log has the highest count. Let's complete a search.

{% highlight ruby %}
sqldf('select host, count(host) as count from logs where login ="slap" group by 1 order by count asc')
{% endhighlight %}

#### Output

{% highlight ruby %}
##             host count
## 1 193.0.96.13.38     1
## 2 194.29.178.155     6
## 3 193.0.96.13.20    33
## 4 194.29.178.108    74
## 5  194.29.178.16   112
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
proton(action="server", host="194.29.178.16")
{% endhighlight %}

#### Output

{% highlight ruby %}
## It turns out that Pietraszko often uses the public workstation 194.29.178.16.
## What carelessness.
## 
## Bit infiltrated this workstation easily. He downloaded `bash_history` file which contains a list of all commands that were entered into the server's console.
## The chances are that some time ago Pietraszko typed a password into the console by mistake thinking that he was logging into the Proton server.
## 
## Problem 4: Find the Pietraszko's password.
## 
## In the `bash_history` dataset you will find all commands and parameters which have ever been entered.
## Try to extract from this dataset only commands (only strings before space) and check whether one of them looks like a password.
{% endhighlight %}

### Challenge 4. Find Password

{% highlight ruby %}
head(bash_history)
{% endhighlight %}

#### Output

{% highlight ruby %}
## [1] "mcedit /var/log/lighttpd/*" "pwd"                       
## [3] "vim /var/log/mysql.*"       "rm /bin"                   
## [5] "cat ~/.Xauthority"          "ls /srv"
{% endhighlight %}

Filter down the commands that are not blank;

{% highlight ruby %}
bash <- data.frame(bash_history)
bash_1 <- sqldf('select distinct * from bash where bash_history not like "% %"')
bash_1
{% endhighlight %}

#### Output

{% highlight ruby %}
##       bash_history
## 1              pwd
## 2               ps
## 3           whoiam
## 4              top
## 5               mc
## 6 DHbb7QXppuHnaXGN
{% endhighlight %}

The username DHbb is complex, let's try this first.

{% highlight ruby %}
proton(action = "login", login="slap", password="DHbb7QXppuHnaXGN")
{% endhighlight %}

#### Output

{% highlight ruby %}
## Congratulations!
## 
## You have cracked Pietraszko's password!
## Secret plans of his lab are now in your hands.
## What is in this mysterious lab?
## You may read about it in the `Pietraszko's cave` story which is available at http://biecek.pl/BetaBit/Warsaw
## 
## Next adventure of Beta and Bit will be available soon.
##             proton.login.pass 
## "Success! User is logged in!"
{% endhighlight %}

Nice work you have completed all of the challenges!
