Strategic talent metrics are a crucial focus for CEOs but are often challenging to drive action due to the amount of information executives consume, creating unnecessary noise or the challenge for some to understand business impact from various descriptive "so what" metrics. 

When you start to shift this model, you can tell a very compelling story to your CEO and change the discussion from something that HR may have high value in, to shared importance around the boardroom. 

Here are my top recruitment metrics for influencing executives, with the most important ones listed first. You must focus on the metrics that will add the most shared value; this will help to drive competition around the table and build trust in indirect cost assumptions.

**New Starter Replacement Cost** 

It is difficult to guarantee that a permanent new hire will remain after a year. This could be influenced by overselling the role, not communicating role expectations, the employee receives a better offer within the period or performance issues. 

There are two parts to this metric;

1. A base number of new hires who exited in the last 12 months filling a permanent role during the previous 12 months.
2. Depending on the role, the cost can be calculated by combining monthly salary with on-costs multiplied by lost productivity. Depending on the role, average productivity at different time periods can be used.

For some roles, i.e. Customer service officer, full productivity may be reached within six months so that the replacement cost impact might be minimal. For mid-level roles, i.e. a senior business analyst or leadership positions, this cost will be more material. 

Once you have this number, is it trending up and if so why, i.e. Drive in specialist recruitment impacting candidate quality, change to the business direction (planned cost) or cultural issues within a part of the business? 

Also, cast your net wide and complete additional analysis to understand why there is movement and if it is good or bad, i.e. If this metric is trending down, great! However, salary increases to make the problem go away is creating a more dangerous problem for the organisation.

**Time to full productivity** 

Depending on the complexity of the role and level of organisation knowledge required, it may take up to 6 months for a customer service officer to reach full productivity, one year and a half for a senior business analyst and up to three years for an executive or director role. 

HR can influence this productivity curve to a significant degree through effective hiring, onboarding, training and cultural practices within the organisation. These initiatives tied to regular feedback provided by new hires could be used to measure the effectiveness through a reduction in ‘time to full productivity’. 

This reduction can then be converted into a dollar benefit, and if this is then compared to the cost of the HR initiative, an ROI can then be calculated.

**Time to onboard** 

For all recruitment processes, this is the measure that best shows when the value is being created by a new hire. It may look scary and does add to complexity as it is a measure of the recruitment process, notice period after offer acceptance and onboarding such a technology, property, compliance training. 

For each day the position is vacant, there is missed opportunity, so it is essential to track the entire vacancy period with the understanding that there may be different interventions and stakeholders to manage to drive improvement.

**New hire conversion to top talent** 

The chances of finding that perfect hire, who can reach full productivity In half the time or innovate a department through new ideas within the first year, could be a 1 in 10 for some organisations. 

Tracking this measure and understanding what key indicators can be used to drive continuous improvement is immensely useful to CEOs to understand the shape of critical inputs to initiatives throughout the year. 

The calculation would look at the percentage of employees that have achieved a desirable stretch event within their first year, i.e. innovation, performance, targets. 

TIP: Although many organisations are moving to a more regular view of performance, some still have annual cycles. Depending on the frequency, you may need to swap between the last 12 months to the achievement of the first event, desirable vs all. 

To create additional impact, compare this measure to all employees that are eligible. If the number is materially higher than group rates, then you may need to explain why. This number should sit at approximately at one-third of the group rate and two thirds for highly effective onboarding programs.

**Vacancy % in revenue generating or critical roles** 

As the organisation experiences high attrition for critical roles or periods of exponential growth, it is essential to track the percentage of these roles that are vacant and work towards reducing these numbers as much as possible. 

This metric is closely related to attrition, however, includes periods of high growth or is better adjusted to seasonality, elements that are missed in an attrition rate. 

This metric also sets the recruitment team up strategically when the organisation is pushed into a recruitment freeze due to changing market conditions or ineffective workforce planning practices and will allow for the intelligence to action short-term initiatives with a reduced negative long-term impact.

**Competitor In/Out Ratio** 

This may only apply to a small proportion of new hires and exits and is an efficient way to measure brand value among competing organisations. Improvements to this measure could see higher quality candidates attracted to your organisation. 

Within your recruitment system, the source can be used to track the latest organisation for the new hire. Exit information can then be supplemented, measured through an exit survey or at the initiation of the exit workflow. This could be either a spot or rolling 12-month measure. 

How does the net movement among competitor organisations fluctuate and is the difference positive or negative, i.e. Knowing what is happening externally such as changes to a competitors business strategy will enable your organisation to react.

**Future Resourcing** 

It’s essential for organisations to plan for the future. At a macro level, total employment cost may have specific forecasts, but there can often be labour cost surprises when approaching an end of period review or financial year. 

Understanding the volume of skills at a BU and role level throughout the year may throw a few challenges to leadership but will help to initiate crucial conversations about the future shape of the organisation. 

Look at a spot voluntary resignation rates by month with replacement new hire rates. You can supplement this with any planned activity, i.e. known retrenchment activity or role growth. 

This could be presented as a simple, moving two lines to indicate where FTE and cost may be impacted and allow HR to influence critical initiatives to improve profitability or set strategies for the long term.
