## Ensuring value in the recruitment and new hire process

Most of us value and measure different recruitment metrics, however many do not provide the right value when measuring the effectiveness of the recruitment pipeline.

Typical measures focus on cost per hire, time to fill and source of hire. These measures often have many more questions than answers and if read incorrectly, may have a negative impact on the organisation when improved.

For example, if we notice that time to hire has increased, we may set a KPI to improve this measure. If we find later down the track that we performed so well on this metric, that it has improved by 20% from 70 to 56 days to fill, that would be wonderful!

Significant improvement to this measure if not looked at from a broader perspective, may have a negative impact on the organisation.

Here are my key recruitment metrics for measuring the effectiveness of the recruitment pipeline:

**1. New Starter Attrition:** This metric focuses on new hire fit to the organisation and one way to measure this is to look at the number of permanent new hires within a 12-month window that has left the organisation. Ideally, you would want to set a benchmark by role and review at the end of each year to understand the significance.

To create a more significant impact on this measure, you could also look at total replacement cost to rehire and or total cost of employment minus revenue (if revenue is generating). Ensuring all things are the same, has this increased or decreased and can anything be segmented to understand if there are any gaps for improvement, e.g. source of hire, selection within the pipeline or management efficiencies in the first year of employment.

Not all new starter turnover can be avoided, however, if employee fit is considered to be crucial, then there is a dollar benefit that can be achieved by looking at data that you should already have in new ways.

**2. Time to Productivity:** This measure is crucial for any business that wants to optimise productivity. Focusing on this metric as a measure of the recruitment pipeline’s performance is possible with the addition of a few key elements.

First look at implementing a job family framework. Identify if the role is revenue generating and then look at how complicated the role is. Performance can then be measured at 6-month probation, and annual review to later gauge productivity. For new employees, has this improved for a similar group of new hires in the past?

To enhance this measure, you could look at machine learning to understand better ways to attract or review for potential performance before the candidate is offered the role (more to come on this in a later post).

**3. Time to onboard:** The number of systems and emphasis on technology can be a nightmare for any manager or new starter that wants to make an early impression. This applies to any role but in particular specialist roles where computer work may be a core requirement.

Once the employee has started with the organisation, most managers keep track of a multitude of activities via a checklist. How much of this information is actually recorded and send back to HR?

Any HR system of value should have critical activities automated via a workflow. Tracking the speed at which an employee has been fully on-boarded and is ready to start work is crucial to understanding where potential bottlenecks may exist so they can speed up for the next new hire.

**4. First-year HiPo Retention:** You may already look at ‘HiPo’ retention as a key organisational metric, that is the percentage of high performing staff that has left the organisation in the last 12 months. For this measure, you could instead look at two years and either understand if there are retention issues or compare trend differences to this high-performance new starter population.

Although it is unusual for a new hire to reach high performance within the first year, if they do achieve this milestone and they leave the organisation within a short period, it should be measured to understand exposure and trend.
