## Getting value from analytics can be challenging 

It can be challenging to drive value in analytics. A recent survey of executives by <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/the-need-to-lead-in-data-and-analytics" target="_blank">'McKinsey'</a> mentioned that key programs have been ‘somewhat effective’ at meeting their primary objective. For HR executives, there is additional complexity to solve for, that includes understanding employee behaviours, disperse system setup and greater scrutiny on workforce data, thus making the challenge even greater. What can we do to improve this perception?

As we approach 2020, five-year workforce plans are being measured on ROI and analytics continues to play a crucial role in driving workforce strategies. Last year represented the biggest growth in people analytics, where 69% of companies studied <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cheetung/2017/12/19/four-key-hr-trends-to-watch-in-2018/#3594162319de" target="_blank">'Forbes 2017'</a>, saying they have actively taken steps to improve the way they look at people data, compared with only 10-15% the year prior. 

This is massive, and the growth is likely to continue, however for many organisations, there is a barrier. This article focuses on getting underneath drivers to why executives struggle in this space with recommendations to improve. 

Why do we want to focus in this space? It will likely come as no surprise, but the following may be important drivers, to make improvements to how information is consumed and create improved decision making capability for the team. 
The difficulty in hiring the right talent. This is driven greater requirements for higher skilled employees, the shortage for such talent as organisations look to shift workforce segments due automation and outsourcing opportunities to drive increased value for the organisation.
Cultural fit and diversity data is becoming more public and is under much greater scrutiny from future employees and media; WGEA, Glassdoor, media spotlight etc.
With increased competition, many CEO’s are looking for ways to optimise spending. This includes understanding the workforce, productivity levels and FTE opportunities. Incorrect balancing could lead to reduced market share, M&A.
Finding a job has never been easier for an employee. While this is nothing new, uses of machine learning and mastery of the tools are having an impact on the ability for a company to poach or retain top talent or an individual to find their next career move.
Dealing with these challenges can be difficult 
First existing processes that have been built have had a key focus on optimising operational efficiency with the data thought of at the end. This makes it difficult to draw insights from the data as it tends to be locked away or in a format that is not usable for the analyst.
HR has much priority’s that dealing with existing workforce challenges, new such as impacts from ‘Gig economy’, digitisation, increased talent competition. This creates a further stretch to resourcing as data processes that support these initiatives are increasingly manual in process resulting in reduced time for insights.
Creating useful insights often involves a super skilled individual to prepare and transform the data. It also required HR problem solver with a few years of experience who is across many policies and processes to then develop the right intervention and actions for insights to be effective.
Systems are dispersed. As mentioned previously, we optimise for the problem and this tends to result in system fragmentation. The creation of analytics, especially for HR due to the complexity of employee behaviours, requires effective storytelling using data obtained from a few systems i.e. Explaining why attrition has increased, may require analysis of career, pay and learning information to understand if there is a correlation to the likelihood of an employee leaving.
Recommendations to improve could include 
Data doesn’t necessarily give you the answers you need. It is best practice to first understand current and future HR strategy and align analytical efforts to these objectives. Once aligned, the data can be used to look around the ‘edges’ to identify secondary opportunities, but the activity is first focused on what matters most to the organisation.
Automate. HR digitisation is focused on increasing the productivity of existing solutions, but you also need to look at how data is stored and used. We suggest creating a database that can be used for analysis, connecting various data sources and reduce dependency on certain software providers. Once established, you can then begin to automate data activities through a programming language like Python or R, both very well known in the data science space.
Create greater impact in KPI measures. Many metrics that I have seen are a little broad to take action, i.e. Attrition rates. They are not specific enough, FTE/Headcount. The first example could be narrowed to focus only on new starter attrition or converted into a financial metric such as ‘replacement cost’. The second is a little misleading as an increase in FTE may cost the organisation less, it will depend on the purpose, but this metric could be converted into employment cost amount or a more complex cost to income measure.
