## Getting value from analytics can be challenging 

It can be challenging to drive value in analytics. A recent survey of executives by <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/the-need-to-lead-in-data-and-analytics" target="_blank">'McKinsey'</a> mentioned that key programs have been ‘somewhat effective’ at meeting their primary objective. For HR executives, there is additional complexity to solve for, that includes understanding employee behaviours, disperse system setup and greater scrutiny on workforce data, thus making the challenge even greater. What can we do to improve this perception?

As we approach 2020, five-year workforce plans are being measured on ROI and analytics continues to play a crucial role in driving workforce strategies. Last year represented the biggest growth in people analytics, where 69% of companies studied <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cheetung/2017/12/19/four-key-hr-trends-to-watch-in-2018/#3594162319de" target="_blank">'Forbes 2017'</a>, saying they have actively taken steps to improve the way they look at people data, compared with only 10-15% the year prior. 

This is massive, and the growth is likely to continue, however for many organisations, there is a barrier. This article focuses on getting underneath drivers to why executives struggle in this space with recommendations to improve.

Why do we want to focus in this space? It will likely come as no surprise, but the following may be important drivers, to make improvements to how information is consumed and create improved decision making capability for the team. 

* The difficulty in hiring the right talent. This is driven greater requirements for higher skilled employees, the shortage for such talent as organisations look to shift workforce segments due automation and outsourcing opportunities to drive increased value for the organisation.
* Cultural fit and diversity data is becoming more public and is under much greater scrutiny from future employees and media; WGEA, Glassdoor, media spotlight etc.
* With increased competition, many CEO’s are looking for ways to optimise spending. This includes understanding the workforce, productivity levels and FTE opportunities. Incorrect balancing could lead to reduced market share, M&A.
* Finding a job has never been easier for an employee. While this is nothing new, uses of machine learning and mastery of the tools are having an impact on the ability for a company to poach or retain top talent or an individual to find their next career move.

**Dealing with these challenges can be difficult.**

1. First existing processes that have been built have had a key focus optimising operational efficiency with the data thought of at the end. This makes it difficult to draw insights from the data as it tends to be locked away or in a format that is not usable by the organisation.
2. HR has many priority’s that deal with existing workforce challenges, new such as impacts from ‘Gig economy’, digitisation, increased talent competition. This creates a further stretch to resourcing as processes that support these initiatives are increasingly manual in process resulting in reduced actionability or create an missed opportunity.
3. Creating useful insights often involves a team of ninja's to prepare, transform and package insights. It also require's a HR problem solver with a few years of experience who is across many policies and processes to then develop the right intervention and actions for insights to be effective.
4. Systems are dispersed. As mentioned previously, we optimise for the problem and this tends to result in system fragmentation. The creation of analytics, especially for HR due to the complexity of employee behaviours, requires effective story telling using data obtained from a few systems, i.e. Explaining why attrition has increased, may require analysis of career, pay and learning information to understand if there is a correlation to likelihood of an employee leaving. Many systems do not talk to each-other effectively.

**Recommendations to improve could include** 

1. Data doesn’t necessarily give you the answers you need. It is best practice to first understand current and future HR strategy and align analytical efforts to these objectives. Once aligned, interventions can be measured to determine ROI and the data can be used to look around the ‘edges’ to identify unknown's, break myth's and allow for early intervention.
2. Automate. HR digitisation is focused on increasing productivity of existing solutions, but you also need to look at how data is stored and used. I suggest creating a database that can be used for analysis, connecting various data sources and reduce dependency on certain software providers. Once established, you can then begin to automate data activities through scripts within Python, R and SQL and then identify activities to shift manual work effort completed by humans, allowing for greater productivity.
3. Understand the impact of metrics. Many metrics that I have seen are a little broad to action, i.e. Attrition and new hire rates. They are not specific enough. Some metrics may be able to be slightly tweaked to add a financial lens, such as churn + lost productivity = cost. The second is completing wider analysis of metric to dimension. If I were to look at churn at a business line level, the complexity of the role level information may have little internal intervention and will likely result in poor interventions that increase cost.
